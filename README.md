# Claude Code Workshop: Accelerating Research with AI

## Overview
This workshop demonstrates how Claude Code transforms research and development workflows. Through hands-on demos, you'll learn to explore codebases, automate tasks, and accelerate research. Suitable for beginners to intermediate users with Claude Code installed. Duration is approximately 2-3 hours with practical exercises. Materials will be expanded based on participant needs and feedback.

## Core Workshop Modules

### 1. MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration
**PyMOL for Molecular Visualization**: Control PyMOL directly from Claude Code to visualize protein structures and molecular dynamics. Automate structure analysis, generate publication-quality figures, and create molecular animations. Perfect for structural biology, drug discovery, and biochemistry research. Demo includes loading PDB files, highlighting residues, and measuring distances programmatically.

**Playwright for Web Automation**: Scrape research databases, automate literature searches, and interact with web-based tools. Extract data from journals, navigate research portals, and collect datasets automatically. Ideal for meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and data gathering. Live demo shows automated PubMed searches and data extraction from research repositories.

### 2. Subagents for Complex Tasks
Learn to create specialized agents that handle specific research workflows autonomously. Watch how agents can break down complex problems and work in parallel. Examples include literature review agents, data analysis agents, and code review agents. See how to chain agents for multi-step research processes like paper reproduction or experiment design.

### 3. GitHub Integration & Complete Development Workflow

**Demo 1: End-to-End Issue Resolution**: Watch Claude Code create an issue, implement the solution, and submit a PR - all automatically. Start by identifying a bug or feature need, create a GitHub issue with detailed description. Claude Code then implements the fix across multiple files and creates a comprehensive PR with tests. Perfect workflow for maintaining research software and responding to user feedback.

**Demo 2: Parallel Feature Development with Git Worktrees**: Develop multiple features simultaneously without branch switching chaos. Set up git worktrees for parallel development, work on different features in isolated directories. Claude Code manages multiple worktrees, keeping each feature separate while maintaining consistency. Ideal for rapid experimentation and comparing different implementations side-by-side.

### 4. Productivity Tips & Hooks
**Custom Hooks**: Set up pre-commit hooks for data validation and post-processing hooks for analysis. Automate quality checks, enforce research standards, and trigger notifications. Examples include automatic figure generation and data integrity checks.

**Workflow Optimization**: Learn keyboard shortcuts, efficient prompting patterns, and context management. Master parallel operations for faster analysis and batch processing techniques. Tips for managing large research codebases and long-running experiments.

### 5. Additional Research Power Features (Lightning Demos)

**Data Science Automation**: Build analysis pipelines with pandas, create visualizations, and generate statistical reports automatically. Demo shows end-to-end workflow from raw data to publication figures.

**Documentation Generation**: Auto-generate comprehensive docs, API references, and method sections from code. Convert implementations to LaTeX equations and maintain research notebooks.

**Experiment Reproducibility**: Track experiments, manage configurations, and ensure reproducibility with automatic versioning and logging.

**Multi-Language Support**: Work seamlessly across Python, R, MATLAB, and Julia for interdisciplinary research.
