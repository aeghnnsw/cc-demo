# Claude Code Workshop Repository

## Purpose
This repository contains demos and materials for the Claude Code workshop. The workshop aims to showcase how Claude Code accelerates research and development workflows. Focus on practical, real-world examples that researchers can immediately apply. Materials will be added incrementally as the workshop develops.

## Workshop Goals
1. Demonstrate powerful code exploration and analysis capabilities
2. Show how to automate repetitive research tasks
3. Illustrate multi-file operations and refactoring
4. Share best practices and tips for effective usage
5. Enable hands-on learning through interactive demos

## Key Demo Areas
- **Code Exploration**: Finding implementations, understanding dependencies, analyzing patterns
- **Automated Refactoring**: Systematic improvements and modernization
- **Documentation & Testing**: Auto-generating docs and comprehensive test suites
- **Research Workflows**: Data analysis, literature review, experiment management
- **Multi-File Operations**: Coordinated changes across codebases

## Guidelines for Claude Code
When working in this repo, create clear and educational demos. Always use the TodoWrite tool for task planning to demonstrate systematic approaches. Include practical examples that workshop participants can relate to. Focus on showcasing research productivity gains. Keep examples simple initially, then progressively increase complexity.

## Repository Structure (To Be Built)
- `/demos` - Hands-on demonstration examples
- `/materials` - Workshop slides and handouts
- `/exercises` - Practice problems for participants
- `/resources` - Tips, tricks, and best practices
